<h1>Welcome to Adora's cooking blog!</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a college student trying to learn how to cook and take better care of myself. I wanted to document my progress with my meals as well as rate different recipes that I try. I hope that you can relate to and learn from my cooking mistakes :)</p>

  <p2>I made spaghetti today with sauce I bought from the store. It was the signature select brand, and I really enjoyed it - would recommend.
